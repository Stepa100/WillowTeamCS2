Perfect! I'll create an amazing CS2 team website with all those features. Let me start by researching esports design patterns and gathering inspiration.
Action: Planning the CS2 team website:

**Structure:**

- Hero section with dramatic CS2 imagery
- Quick stats/achievements
- Featured tournament section
- Recent news/updates
- Team roster preview
- Match schedule
- Rankings display

**Design Direction:**
- Dark theme (gaming aesthetic)
- Accent colors: Orange/red (CS2 fire theme) with electric blue accents
- Typography: Space Grotesk for headings (tech/gaming feel), Inter for body
- Particle effects in hero section
- Glassmorphism for cards
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Sharp, angular design elements (tactical theme)

**Components Needed:**
- Navigation bar with logo

Let me search for design inspiration and then build this.

Provider: perplexity
Model: sonar

Observation: Based on 2024 design trends, an esports team website for CS2 should prioritize **dark themes with strategic accent colors**, **immersive interactive elements**, and **intuitive tournament-focused navigation**[1][2][3].

## Design Aesthetics

**Dark backgrounds** align with gaming industry standards and create a modern, professional appearance[1]. Pair your dark theme with **vibrant accent colors or gradients** to create visual interest—platforms like Instagram have sparked a resurgence in gradient design that works well for gaming aesthetics[3]. Consider **metallic blue accents** or colors that complement your team's branding, similar to successful gaming site designs[1].

## Interactive and Immersive Features

Incorporate **3D animations, parallax scrolling, and dynamic motion effects** to create engaging experiences[1][2][5]. Motion effects—including kinetic typography and animated logos—add visual intrigue at relatively low cost and help your site stand out as more websites compete for attention[5]. **Scroll-triggered animations** and **hover effects** provide immediate feedback and keep users actively engaged[2].

## Navigation and User Experience

Prioritize **UX-focused design** with intuitive, easy-to-navigate content that quickly conveys necessary information[5]. Your layout should emphasize:

- **Tournament schedules and results** prominently displayed
- **Player rosters and statistics** easily accessible
- **Game selection highlights** (CS2-specific content)
- **Clear call-to-action buttons** for tickets, merchandise, or team information

**Minimalist layouts** with clean organization reduce cognitive load and help visitors find information without unnecessary clutter[1][2].

## Cross-Platform Considerations

Ensure your design works seamlessly on **mobile devices**, as prospective fans are far more likely to discover and engage with your site using mobile[4]. Test motion effects across different platforms to avoid performance issues on mobile[3].

## Personalization Elements

Implement **AI-driven personalization** to tailor content based on user behavior—such as recommending relevant tournament brackets or player highlights based on browsing history[2][6].

Action: Running Web Search with query: gaming website color palette dark theme orange red electric blue cyberpunk tactical esports
Provider: perplexity
Model: sonar

Observation: A **cyberpunk-inspired dark theme color palette** for a gaming website targeting tactical esports should prioritize deep blacks and charcoals as the base for immersion, accented by **vibrant orange, red, and electric blue** neons for high-energy highlights like CTAs, player stats, and HUD elements.[1][2][4]

### Core Palette (5-7 Colors)
Use this balanced set for dark mode versatility, drawing from cyberpunk staples like neon contrasts on shadows:
- **Primary Background**: #2C2C2E (deep charcoal) or #2C3E50 (navy) – Provides a moody, tactical void for maps and leaderboards.[1][4]
- **Secondary Dark**: #003062 (dark blue-gray) – For subtle gradients in menus or shadows.[5]
- **Neon Orange Accent**: #FF9A00 or #F39C12 – Energizes tactical overlays, weapon icons, or win notifications.[1]
- **Fiery Red Highlight**: #FF3D00, #E74C3C, or #FF184C – Signals alerts, blood effects, or esports team colors; evokes urgency in competitive play.[1][2][5]
- **Electric Blue Neon**: #00BFFF (sky blue), #0A9CF5, or pale neon blue – Core cyberpunk glow for health bars, cybernetic UI, and electric effects.[1][2][4][5]
- **Supporting Purple/Violet**: #A700FF or #9B59B6 – Adds depth for rank badges or glitch animations.[1][4]
- **Warning Yellow**: #FFD600 or #FFEA00 – Sparse use for critical alerts, balancing the palette without overwhelming the dark theme.[1]

| Role | Hex Codes | Usage Example | Cyberpunk Vibe |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Dark Base** | #2C2C2E, #003062 | Backgrounds, cards | Tech Noir abyss[1] |
| **Orange** | #FF9A00, #F39C12 | Energy bars, buttons | Sunset cyber glow[1] |
| **Red** | #FF3D00, #FF184C | Damage, CTAs | Blood red motivation[2][5] |
| **Electric Blue** | #0A9CF5, #00BFFF | Neons, outlines | High-tech freedom[2] |
| **Purple** | #A700FF | Accents, borders | Futuristic edge[1][4] |

### Implementation Tips
- **Dark Theme Hierarchy**: 80% dark shades for readability during long esports sessions; limit neons to 20% for focus on gameplay previews.[2][3]
- **Accessibility**: Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratios (e.g., electric blue text on charcoal passes WCAG); test with tools for color-blind modes.[4]
- **Esports Tactical Feel**: Pair with glitch effects or holographic overlays; orange/red for aggressive teams, blue for defensive strategies.[1][4]
- **Variations**: For more intensity, swap in teal (#00BFAE) for blue alternatives or blood red (#FF577D) for softer reds.[1][5]

This palette synthesizes Cyberpunk 2077 influences with vibrant neons on dark bases, ideal for engaging gaming sites without eye strain.[2][3][6]
